The Number Guessing Game is a console-based Java mini project that demonstrates the use of core Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and challenges the user to guess it correctly.

⚙️ How the Project Works

The program generates a random number using Math.random().

The user enters guesses through the keyboard using the Scanner class.

After each guess, the program compares the user’s input with the generated number.

The program provides feedback:

Too large if the guess is higher than the number

Too small if the guess is lower than the number

Correct if the guess matches the number

The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.

Once guessed correctly, the program displays a success message and reveals the number.
